In this repository, I implemented changes and displayed them in the database found in the db folder, connecting it to the javascript code.
The model file is where the database is being changed/accessed.
In the controller, I set the different functions or actions to be displayed on a browser.
In the app file, I set the API to a different accessible or modifiable API, listening to the listen file and hosting it locally on port 9090.
